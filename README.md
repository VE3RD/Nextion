# Nextion Screen  2.4"
This screen was developed by Mitch EA7KDO and published on www.githud/ea7kdo/nextion.images
I have modified this screen with mainly cosmetic changes to suit myself and no one else.

The script [gitcopy.sh] will copy the source files for the Nextion Screen from github and place them in their appropriate directories ready to flash from the flash page on your hotspot. If you have a fash button on your screen prov ided my my version or the EA7KDO Version, Use it to flash the new screen set.
